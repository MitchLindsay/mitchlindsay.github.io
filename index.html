    Hello! My name is Mitch Lindsay. I'm a Computer Science graduate looking to start a career in software development.
    I've been using computers since I was about 8 years old, when my parents bought an HP machine running Windows 98.
    My interest in programming started with game development. I began by creating "Choose Your Own Adventure" style
    games on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> and messing around in RPG Maker.
    As I grew older, I branched out to various game development platforms including Multimedia Fusion, GameMaker, BlitzBasic,
    Microsoft XNA, and eventually Unity3D. I attended college at <a href="http://www.stvincent.edu/">Saint Vincent College</a>
    where I learned the principles of programming and software design. You can find more details about
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/education">my education</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/work">my work</a>,
    and <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">my projects</a> on this site. You can also
