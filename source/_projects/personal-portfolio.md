+ My personal portfolio website.
+ The website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Jekyll-Assets](http://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-assets/), and a combination of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to speed up development time.
+ Styles and fonts are used and modified from the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) libraries.
