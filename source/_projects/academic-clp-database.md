+ In our Software Engineering class, as a group, we designed and developed a Microsoft Access database to track attendance for the Academic Collaborative Learning Program. My responsibilities on the project were a combination of SQL queries and user interface.
+ The database accepts data from several Excel spreadsheets. A user can generate reports to compare class performance of students who attended the program with those who did not attend. These reports can be filtered through a variety of criteria to show students of a particular major, grade, etc.
