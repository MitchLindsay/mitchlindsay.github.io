+ For my Senior Capstone Project, I developed a Tile Map Editor for use in 2D computer games.
+ The interface was created using WinForms and the graphics rendering was handled by the XNA framework.
+ Users can import their own images (tile sheets) and use them as a palette to create a 2D map. After the tile map is complete, the map can be saved or exported as an XML file. Previously created maps can be loaded to view or edit.
