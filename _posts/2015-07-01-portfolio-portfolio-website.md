* I created a personal portfolio website as a place to display information
about my coursework, my work experience, and my programming projects.

* The site was developed with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
The website is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). All icons are
from the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicons.com/) icon font.
