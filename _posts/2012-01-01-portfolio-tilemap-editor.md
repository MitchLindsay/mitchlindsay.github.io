* For my Senior Capstone Project, I developed a 2D Tile Map Editor with C# and the
[Microsoft XNA Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA). The interface
was created as a WinForms application and the graphics rendering was handled by XNA.

* Users can import their own images (tile sheets) and use them as a palette to
create a 2D map. After the tile map is complete, users can then save the map or
export it as an XML file. They can also load or import a previously created map to
view or edit.
