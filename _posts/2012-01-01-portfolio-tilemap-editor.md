A map editor for two-dimensional video games. The editor was created for my Senior
Capstone Project and was created in C# with [Microsoft XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA).
With the editor, you can load in your own tile set files. The tile set acts as a palette,
allowing you to paint your own 2D maps. The maps can then be exported into XML format.
