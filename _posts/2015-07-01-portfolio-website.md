## Portfolio Website
[Source Code](https://github.com/MitchLindsay/mitchlindsay.github.io) | 2015

A portfolio website developed to showcase my work. It was developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Icons were included in the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicons.com/).
