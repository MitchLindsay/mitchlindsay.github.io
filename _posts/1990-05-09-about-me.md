##Who am I?##

Hi, I'm Mitch Lindsay.

I'm a hobbyist developer and computer science graduate looking to begin a career in software development.
Aside from programming, I enjoy video games (mostly of the multiplayer variety), dark drama TV shows, and
fresh coffee. <i class="icon ion-coffee"></i>

##Origins##

My interest in computing began when I was about 8 years old, when my parents
bought an HP computer running Windows 98. I was (and still am) very interested in making my
own games.

I made "Choose Your Own Adventure" style websites on good old [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities).
I also tinkered around in RPG Maker. Over the years, I branched out to other game development platforms,
including: Multimedia Fusion, GameMaker, BlitzBasic, Microsoft XNA, and recently Unity3D.

I pursued a degree in Computer Science at [Saint Vincent College](http://www.stvincent.edu/)
where I learned an enormous amount.

##Skills##

I consider myself proficient in C# along with Unity3D and Photoshop. I frequently
use Git for source control. I also have experience with the following: C++, HTML/CSS,
Java, JavaScript, Microsoft XNA, MySQL, PHP, Python, and Visual Basic.
